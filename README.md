# Network-Discoverer

This Java program I wrote is used to sniff the network interfaces and IP addresses of a local host. It begins by obtaining the localhost address using the InetAddress.getLocalHost() method. It then uses the NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces() method to get all of the network interfaces associated with the localhost. For each of these network interfaces, it uses the NetworkInterface.getInetAddresses() method to obtain the IP addresses associated with them. Finally, it prints out each network interface and its associated IP address. It does this by getting the localhost address, then getting a list of all the network interfaces on the computer, and then looping through each network interface to retrieve the IP addresses associated with it. Finally, it prints out the local host address and each IP address associated with each network interface.
